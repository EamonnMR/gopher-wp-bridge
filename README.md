# gopher-wp-bridge

Python gopher server using [https://github.com/dotcomboom/Pituophis/](https://github.com/dotcomboom/Pituophis/) and Wordpress's API to expose your wordpress site to the phlogosphere.

## How

Pass your desired wordpress site's URL and port with environment variables like so:

`URL='http://wordpress.example.com' PORT='7070' python server.py`

## Why

Because I'm not just a luddite, I'm an incredibly lazy luddite.

## Project status

Experimental. Lacks basic capabilities; right now it's just a menu with your last ten posts.
